                <p>I will present an extension of Martin-L√∂f Type Theory that contains a tiny object; a type for which there is an "amazing" right adjoint to the formation of function types as well as the expected left adjoint. A primary aim of the theory is to be simple enough to be used both by hand and in a (hypothetical) proof assistant. I will sketch a normalisation algorithm and discuss a few potential applications, in particular, to implementations of Cubical Type Theory.</p>

                <p>In this talk, I'll present recent results in synthetic ‚àû-category theory in an extension of homotopy type theory. An ‚àû-category is analogous to a 1-category, but with composition defined only up to homotopy. To reason about them in HoTT, Riehl and Shulman proposed simplicial HoTT, an extension by a directed interval, generating the shapes that model arrows and their composition.</p>
                <p>To account for fundamental constructions like the opposite category or the maximal subgroupoid, we add further type formers as modalities using Gratzer-Kavvos-Nuyts-Birkedal's framework of multimodal dependent type theory (MTT).</p>
                <p>I'll present the construction of the universe ùíÆ of small ‚àû-groupoids in that setting which we can show to be an ‚àû-category satisfying directed univalence. As an application, we can define various ‚àû-categories of interest in higher algebra such as ‚àû-monoids and ‚àû-groups. Furthermore, I'll show the construction of the fully functorial Yoneda embedding w.r.t. ùíÆ as well as the Yoneda lemma (which is hard to establish in set-theoretic foundations).</p>
                <p>If time permits, I will outline further developments in synthetic ‚àû-presheaf theory, namely first steps in the theory of Kan extensions, including a proof of Quillen's Theorem A and the properness of cocartesian fibrations.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>This talk will present Lean4Lean, a project to construct a verified checker for the Lean theorem prover in the style of MetaCoq. It consists of a new "external verifier" for Lean, written in Lean. It is the first complete verifier for Lean 4 other than the reference implementation in C++ used by Lean itself, and the new verifier is competitive with the original, running between 20% and 50% slower and usable to verify all of Lean's mathlib library, forming an additional step in Lean's aim to self-host the full elaborator and compiler. The second part of the project concerns the type theory itself, and establishing its properties (in spite of several known negative results about the behavior of the type system), with the ultimate goal of being able to show that the verifier is correct to a specification of the type theory, and that the type theory is consistent relative to ZFC with countably many inaccessible cardinals. This work is still ongoing but we plan to use this project to help justify any future changes to the kernel and type theory and ensure unsoundness does not sneak in through either the abstract theory or implementation bugs.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Condensed mathematics is a recently-introduced setting for applying methods of higher category theory to objects of topological nature. The category Cond of condensed sets can be viewed as an approximation of the category of topological spaces by a topos. We identify two classes of maps of Cond, that we call "etale" and "proper", that correspond to local homeomorphisms and to proper maps of topological spaces respectively, and we propose type-theoretic axioms concerning these that express the sense in which Cond is a "category of spaces", and not only a "category of sets".</p>
                <p>The focus of this talk will be on the "directed path types" of a condensed set (or groupoid), which correspond to the specialization order on the points of a topological space, and are defined using the Sierpinski condensed set as "directed interval". Etale and proper maps have unique lifting properties with respect to the two endpoints of this interval, and so are analogous to left and right fibrations of simplicial spaces. The aim of the talk is to explain this (imperfect) analogy from both an external and an internal perspective, to try to shed light on possible relationships with recent and current work in simplicial and directed type theories.</p>
                <p>This talk is based on joint work with Johan Commelin.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In classical programming language theory, characterizing data types as initial algebras of an endofunctor that represents a specification of the data types is an important tool. In this work, we observe that the category of algebras of such an endofunctor is often enriched in its category of coalgebras. This enrichment carries strictly more information than the traditional, unenriched category. For example, when considering the endofunctor whose initial algebra is the natural numbers, we find that the enrichment encodes a notion of `partial' homomorphism, while the unenriched category encodes only `total' homomorphisms. We can also leverage this extra information to generalize the notion of initial algebras, following the theory of weighted limits. This is joint work with Maximilien P√©roux and Lukas Mulder.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Internal language theorems are fundamental in categorical logic, since they express an equivalence between syntax and semantics. One of such theorems was proven by Clairambault and Dybjer, who corrected the result originally by Seely. More specifically, they constructed a biequivalence between the bicategory of locally Cartesian closed categories and the bicategory of democratic categories with families with extensional identity types, ‚àë-types, and ‚àè-types. This theorem expresses that, up to adjoint equivalence, the internal language of locally Cartesian closed categories is extensional Martin-L√∂f type theory with dependent sums and products.</p>
                <p>In this talk, we prove the theorem by Clairambault and Dybjer for univalent categories, and we extend their biequivalence to various classes of toposes, among which are ‚àè-pretoposes and elementary toposes. Univalent categories give an interesting framework for studying internal language theorems of dependent type theory. This is because of the fact that univalent categories are identified up to adjoint equivalence, and that internal language theorems give us biequivalence for various classes of categories and theories. In addition, we shall see that univalence gives us several ways to simplify the necessary constructions and proofs, because it allows us to transfer properties and structure along equivalences for free.</p>
                <p>The results in this paper have been formalized using the proof assistant Coq and the UniMath library. The material in this talk is based on the preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06636">https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06636</a>.</p>

                <p>HoTT/UF aims not only to be framework for synthetic homotopy theory, but also a suitable foundation for "set-level" constructive mathematics. In this talk we want to support this claim by discussing how the basic theory of schemes, the fundamental notion of modern algebraic geometry, can be set up in HoTT/UF. The classical literature contains two different approaches to schemes: schemes as locally ringed spaces and schemes as functors. We will show how both of these can be made constructive and predicative and discuss what kind of issues arise when defining qcqs-schemes using either approach in HoTT/UF. Finally, we give a sketch of a univalent proof that the two constructive definitions coincide.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>A fundamental question in Fourier analysis is the Fourier inversion theorem, which states that for nice functions, applying the Fourier transform twice gives the original function back up to reversal. This is true for continuously differentiable functions, but the situation is a lot more subtle for e.g. continuous functions. In this case the Fourier transform might not be integrable, and one has to consider improper integrals. Moreover, this improper integral need not converge at every point, but in 1966 Lennart Carleson proved that it does converge at almost all points for functions on the real line. This result follows from the boundedness of the Carleson operator. Carleson's proof is famously hard to read, and there are no known easy proofs of this theorem.</p>
                <p>We have proven a generalization of the boundedness of the Carleson's operator in the setting of doubling metric measure spaces, and we are currently working on formalizing the entire proof in the proof assistant Lean, based on a detailed blueprint we wrote first. This advanced formalization is possible because of Lean's large mathematical library Mathlib.</p>
                <p>In this talk I will give an overview of the project including its practical aspects, as well as highlighting some other exciting projects around Mathlib. No background in Fourier analysis is assumed.</p>

                <p>In systems with internal parametricity, we get propagation and preservation of relations through/by all functions for free. In HoTT, we get preservation of equivalences by all functions for free. In directed type theory, we get preservation of morphisms by all (covariant) functions for free.</p>
                <p>None of these three properties by itself is satisfactory: if we weaken equivalences or morphisms to relations, we lose their computational behaviour. If we want to rely on preservation of non-invertible morphisms, we need our functions to be covariant. And finally, simply not every morphism/relation is an equivalence.</p>
                <p>We set out to develop a type system that has all three preservation properties in an interactive manner, so that we can preserve isomorphisms when available, morphisms when covariant, and relations as a last resort. Such a system should provide us with functoriality (fmap), parametricity and naturality proofs for free. I call such a system "Naturality Type Theory".</p>
                <p>In this first step, I consider Naturality *Pre*type Theory: I defer all considerations of fibrancy to intuition and future work. In particular, I do not yet worry too much about the specifics of composition of and transport along morphisms.</p>
                <p>By instantiating parametrized systems such as Multimod(e/al) Type Theory (MTT) and the Modal Transpension System (MTraS), we can moreover separate concerns and only worry about the presheaf model at every mode, and the modalities that we can model as adjunctions between these presheaf models, leaving syntactic matters to research on MTT and MTraS.</p>
                <p>The presheaf models are designed to accommodate yet-to-be-defined higher pro-arrow equipments, and can be invented in three ways: (1) as a higher-dimensional version of pro-arrow equipments, (2) as a heterogenization of Tamsamani &amp; Simpson's model of higher category theory, and (3) as a directification of Degrees of Relatedness.</p>
                <p>In this talk, after motivating the subject, I intend to introduce the main ideas and then spiral towards the technical details, starting from the three existing settings/structures/models mentioned above.</p>

                <p>Sphere bundles arise naturally in many contexts, often as the unit sphere bundles associated to vector bundles. For example, a manifold has a sphere bundle associated to its tangent bundle. In order to distinguish these bundles and to learn more about the manifolds, it's important to understand invariants of sphere bundles, such as the Euler class and the Thom class which live in cohomology groups. This talk will begin with a review of bundles and oriented bundles, and will then take a detour to discuss central types. We'll use central types to produce new models of Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces. One of the themes of the talk will be that by using an appropriate model of an Eilenberg-Mac Lane space, we can give concrete descriptions of its H-space structure (which represents addition in cohomology) and of the cup product operation. Moreover, we'll show that by using these models, we can give very simple descriptions of the Euler class and Thom class of an oriented sphere bundle, and can prove theorems about them, such as the relationship between the two and the Whitney sum formula. I will also mention our work constructing the tangent sphere bundles of spheres and on the hairy ball theorem, which shows that the tangent sphere bundle of the n-sphere has a section if and only if n is odd.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Historically, constructive cubical interpretations of HoTT interpret types as families equipped with an "open box-filling" operation, which ensures that identities in types can be interpreted as maps from an interval. This choice of structure was inspired by Kan's early work on cubical sets. However, cubical type theory inteprets in forms of cubical sets not considered by Kan, indeed rarely considered in the homotopy-theoretical literature. In these settings, it is a priori unclear whether a box-filling operation is really what should qualify a cubical set as a "space" in a standard sense. I'll present arguments that for many forms of cubical set used in interpretations of HoTT, this is in fact not the case. Concretely, we show that in these settings, Quillen model structures based on box-filling fibrations are not Quillen equivalent to model categories (such as the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets) which do present spaces.</p>

Examples of such constructions arise in disparate areas of mathematics, and are unified by the intuition that the resulting total category is a form of "semidirect product" of the category of parameters, which acts on the category the parametric endofunctor is defined on.

                <p>In this talk I'll present the main ideas of my new proof of homotopy canonicity for HoTT (see arXiv:2311.05849).</p>
                <p>Constructive models of HoTT, such as cubical set models, provide a computational interpretation of the univalence axiom. Homotopy canonicity, originally conjectured by Voevodsky, implies that the computational content of univalence can already be observed in the</p>
                <p>syntax.</p>
                <p>Canonicity results are usually proven using a sconing construction, gluing together the syntax and a semantic model. For homotopy canonicity, the semantic model should be a model of HoTT, say cubical sets. To carry out the sconing construction, the components of the base model should also be cubical sets with the correct higher dimensional structure. However the components of the syntax are only sets, which can be seen as discrete cubical sets, with the "wrong" higher dimensional structure.</p>
                <p>This can be solved by constructing the "strict Rezk completion" of the syntax, which is an equivalent model with the correct higher dimensional structure. Strict Rezk completions can be constructed in cartesian cubical sets.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In the setting of homotopy type theory, each type can be interpreted as a space. Moreover, given an element of a type, i.e. a point in the corresponding space, one can define another type which encodes the space of loops based at this point. In particular, when the type we started with is a groupoid, this loop space is always a group. Conversely, to every group we can associate a type (more precisely, a pointed connected groupoid) whose loop space is this group: this operation is called *delooping*. The generic procedures for constructing such deloopings of groups (based on torsors, or on descriptions of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces as higher inductive types) are unfortunately equipped with elimination principles which do not directly allow eliminating to arbitrary types, and are thus difficult to work with in practice. Here, we construct deloopings of the cyclic groups Z_m which are *cellular*, and thus do not suffer from this shortcoming. In order to do so, we provide type-theoretic implementations of *lens spaces*, which constitute an important family of spaces in algebraic topology. In some sense, this work generalizes the construction of real projective spaces by Buchholtz and Rijke in their LICS'17 paper, which handles the case m = 2, although the general setting requires more involved tools. Finally, we use this construction to also provide cellular descriptions of dihedral groups, and explain how we can hope to use those to compute the cohomology and higher actions of such groups.</p>

                <p>It is interesting to observe that a use-case of what deserves to be called genuine ‚Äúhomotopical computation‚Äù is secretly known: We showed in arXiv:2303.02382 (in print at Comm. Math. Phys., see <a href="ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/TQC+in+HoTT">ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/TQC+in+HoTT</a>) that the specification of the logic gates envisioned in ‚Äútopological quantum computation on anyons‚Äù, while intricate in traditional language, have a slick expression in HoTT, simply as transport of certain truncated dependent function types into Eilenberg-MacLane types. The mathematical theorems behind this are a remarkable result on conformal quantum field theory by Feigin, Schechtmann & Varchenko (1994) combined with our novel algebro-topological construction, lending itself to formalization in HoTT, of Gauss-Manin connections on fibrations of twisted cohomology groups.</p>
                <p>Generally, the relation between HoTT and quantum computation is closer than might be suspected: Adding rules meant to enforce interpretation of HoTT into infinity-topoi of parameterized module spectra (such as Riley‚Äôs *Linear HoTT*) naturally provides for an expressive certification-language for quantum programming with ‚Äúdynamic lifting‚Äù of quantum measurement results (arXiv:2310.15735, <a href="ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Quantum+Monadology">ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Quantum+Monadology</a>), previously elusive but arguably necessary for any serious quantum computation.</p>

We'll then compute the Euler class of the tangent sphere bundles with an explicit construction. Generalizing from this case, we'll define a preliminary notion of "homotopy manifold" and use an abstract lemma about pushout products to define the product of homotopy manifold structures. This will give us tangent bundles on products of spheres as well. All of this will take place in ordinary book HoTT, and a good deal of it has already been formalized in Coq.</p>

                <p>Where do some of our most cherished inductive definitions come from? Which functions are we excluding when we form the type of all functions between two types? Does every field have an algebraic closure?</p>
                <p>Inspired by the modal approach to the set-theoretic multiverse of Joel David Hamkins, Victoria Gitman and their collaborators, we aim to introduce the modal operators "everywhere" and "somewhere" to homotopy type theory, proposing a multiversal perspective on these motivating questions.</p>

                <p>In 1978 Aczel gave a model of constructive set theory (CZF), which includes theaxiom of foundation, in Martin-L√∂f type theory (MLTT) [1]. Then, in 1989, Lindstr√∂m gave a different model, also in MLTT, of constructive set theory, butwith foundation replaced by Aczel's anti-foundation axiom (AFA) [2]. Both of these models were setoid based. Starting from Aczel's 1978 model of well-founded sets, Gylterud defined a subtype of the type Aczel used. This subtype is in fact the initial algebra of the (restricted) powerset functor, and thus also forms a model of constructive set theory, but one where equality is interpreted as the identity type [3].</p>
                <p>In this work, we dualise the construction of Gylterud, to obtain a model of non-wellfounded sets, where equality is interpreted as the identity type, as opposed to Lindstr√∂m's model. The expectation was that the dualised construction would be the terminal coalgebra of the powerset functor, in which case it would be a model of CZF‚Åª together with AFA. It turns out, however, that it is not the terminal coalgebra of the powerset functor. But all is not lost, for it is a fixed point of the functor, and in addition, it is terminal with respect to embeddings. This gives us instead a model of CZF‚Åª together with Scott's anti-foundation axiom.</p>

                <p>Reasoning in higher category theory can be quite difficult and synthetic theories help internalise common arguments to simplify proofs. Synthetic theories also often admit automation in a form of proof assistants, which further help verify results with the help of the computer. Rzk is an experimental proof assistant for synthetic ‚àû-categories, based on the type theory with shapes by Emily Riehl and Michael Shulman [1], which in turn is an extension of homotopy type theory with a tope logic layer and extension types. In a joint work with Emily Riehl and Jonathan Weinberger, we formalize the ‚àû-categorical Yoneda lemma in Rzk. Thanks to synthetic theory, many constructions in the formalization are automatically natural or functorial. In this talk, I will present the basics of theorem proving in Rzk, and outline the main result of our formalization project. Additionally, I will talk briefly about the implementation of Rzk itself, plans for its development, and some ideas for implementing proof assistants based on dependent types in general.</p>

                <p>While one can use HoTT to talk about topics in the traditional algebraic topology of spaces, the difference in language and culture leads people using HoTT to prefer some styles of argument that are less common in traditional algebraic topology. There are some habits of thought I think algebraic topologists can profitably adopt from HoTT and in this talk I'll present examples, chief among them, the willingness to pass freely from a type family to its dependent sum and back. This talk will be more philosophical than technical and is mostly intended as bait, to get experts in HoTT to teach me (decidedly a non-export!) more tricks I can profitably steal.</p>

                <p>To a first approximation, modal type theories aim to extend Martin-Loef type theory with a connective which is not invariant under substitution. Naively performing such an extension will cause the substitution lemma to fail and so each modal type theory must also modify MLTT's judgments in some manner. Each such modification changes and restricts contexts and substitutions to obtain a theory which admits both the modality and a substitution lemma. One such modification extends type theory with a dependent adjunction [Birkedal et al. 2020]. Essentially, modalities behave like right adjoints with an adjoint action on contexts. In this talk we propose a weakening of the notion of dependent adjunction as a unifying abstraction for several seemingly distinct modal type theories: dual-context, left division, and Fitch-style. We explore the resulting connections between MTT - a type theory based around weak DRAs - and these other theories.</p>

                <p>Observational Type Theory (OTT) extends dependent type theory with an equality that satisfies extensionality principles for functions and propositions, as well as quotient types. But unlike HoTT, the equality of OTT is a proposition that does not contain any higher structure. Thus, if HoTT is the language of infinity-groupoids, OTT is the language of propositions and sets.</p>
                <p>In this talk I will go over the integration of OTT with the Calculus of Inductive Constructions‚Äîthe theory of Coq‚Äîwhich supports both impredicative propositions and a large class of inductive types.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In cubical sets there are two different notions of proposition. They are a locally cartesian closed category and so model of extensional type theory, in which the propositions are monomorphisms. They are also a model of HoTT into which we can interpret the definition of h-proposition. In general h-propositions can behave very differently to monomorphisms, when working in cubical sets in a constructive setting. Instead of thinking of them as spaces with at most one point, it is better to visualise them as spaces with possibly a lot of points, but with a path joining any two.</p>
                <p>Double negation stable h-propositions are an important subclass that are much better behaved then h-propositions in general. Unlike the general case, every double negation stable h-proposition in cubical sets is equivalent to a monomorphism. Using this we can construct a classifier for all double negation stable h-propositions in cubical sets and moreover describe it explicitly: it is the constant presheaf on the classifier for double negation stable monomorphisms in our metatheory. Although double negation stability is a somewhat restrictive condition, this classifier suffices for at least three important constructions: the Dedekind real numbers, 0-truncated double negation sheafification, and formulating and proving consistency of a version of extended Church's thesis (all partial functions are computable).</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In set-theoretic foundations, the final coalgebra of a finitary functor can be constructed in (œâ+œâ) steps [Worrell (2005)]. For particular finitary functors, constructive proofs of this exist, and for polynomial functors it is known that the same can be done constructively in œâ steps [Ahrens, Capriotti (2015)].</p>
                <p>Similarly, the intermediate class of analytic functors yields final coalgebras in œâ steps when working classically. We are interested whether the same is true when working internally to HoTT. We focus our work on the finite multiset functor, a particular analytic functor.</p>
                <p>One approach is to directly work with a set-level definition of the functor. This involves proving that it preserves œâ-limits. In general, this requires a form of countable choice, which nonetheless seems to be satisfied for the limits involved in the construction of the final coalgebra.</p>
                <p>We present an alternative construction following [Kock (2012)]. Here, we define a polynomial functor over a groupoid, and show that its pointwise set-trunctation is equivalent to the ordinary finite multiset functor. We construct its final coalgebra as an œâ-limit, and show that it has as a fixed-point a type of finitely branching, non-wellfounded trees. While the truncation of this type of trees is a fixed-point of the ordinary multiset functor, proving that it is the largest fixed-point requires another choice principle.</p>
                <p>In the process, we give multiple formalizations of finite multisets in HoTT, one as type of lists modulo permutations, and another one as the HIT of the free commutative monoid, and connect these to prior work, e.g. [Choudhury, Fiore (2021)]. To overcome size-issues, we port [Finster et al. (2021)]'s axiomatization of a small type of finite sets and bijections to cubical Agda.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>This talk consists of two parts:</p>
                <p>First, we explore just how far one can get to the goal of constructing semi-simplicial types in MLTT. When being first introduced to the problem, it strikes one that there is an evident pattern in simplex types. We codify this pattern using the notion of a simple inverse category and construct untyped syntactic expressions. A challenge is posed to the audience to construct typing derivations, hence "externally" constructing SSTs. Unfortunately, it seems that internalising typing derivations is not possible (HoTT can't eat itself).</p>
                <p>Second, we propose a work in progress modification to MLTT that we expect to enable the construction of SSTs. We generalise from asking for a type of SSTs to asking for a type structure of SSTs, which includes every order of dependent/displayed SSTs. In this more general setting, the object "SST" acquires a universal property that can be expressed via the notion of non-Type-valued coinduction. We explain how this endows "SST" with a mapping-in universal property that enables extracting simplex types. To demonstrate the utility of this universal property, we construct the singular semi-simplicial types.</p>
                <p>The second half of this talk consists of joint work with Michael Shulman.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>We explore the concepts of (co)ends and strong dinaturality in the setting of homotopy type theory, and articulate their connections to existing lines of work. Strong dinaturality is the appropriate generalization of the naturality conditions used by Awodey, Frey, and Speight to 'refine' System-F-style impredicative encodings of inductive types, and provides a convenient calculus for determining these conditions. Moreover, since strong dinaturality can be expressed using the category-theoretic notion of ends, there is an evident dualization using coends which allows for impredicative encodings of coinductive and existential types in homotopy type theory. We also discuss the connection between strong dinaturality and parametric polymorphism. For apparently all cases of interest, strong dinaturality articulates precisely (as a propositional equality) the naturality condition needed to restrict polymorphic types to only 'standard' values. We demonstrate this fact by calculating several of the 'free theorems' of Wadler in our strong dinaturality calculus.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>It is well known that the epimorphisms in the category of sets are exactly the surjections. But what are the epimorphisms of types? Thinking of types as spaces, and following literature in algebraic topology, we characterise epimorphisms of types in HoTT as so-called acyclic maps. An acyclic map is a map whose fibres are acyclic types, and a type is acyclic if its suspension is contractible. We also consider a weaker notion: a type is k-acyclic (for k ‚â• -2) if its suspension is k-connected. We show, for example, that the classifying type of a group G is 2-acyclic if and only if the group G is perfect, i.e. its abelianisation is trivial. Finally, we comment on the relations between acyclic and connected maps and sketch directions for future research.</p>

                <p>We give a simple description of the type of H-space structures on a pointed type A. If A is an H-space, we obtain an untruncated version of a formula of Arkowitz--Curjel and Copeland for counting H-space structures on a space. This formula underlies the classical computations of the number of H-space structures on various spaces. As an example, we easily deduce that the type of H-space structures on the 3-sphere is equivalent to the six-fold loop space of the 3-sphere.</p>
                <p>Our formula for the type of H-space structures on A leads us to define and study what we call "central" types, which are generalisations of Eilenberg--Mac Lane types. Central types admit a unique H-space structure which can be explicitly delooped by a tensor product of "types banded by A." Given an abelian group A, we iterate this process to give an independent construction of K(A,n) along with a description of its H-space structure that is useful for certain cohomology computations.</p>

                <p>Given a cube category with cartesian structure (faces, degeneracies, diagonals, and permutations), we know that its category of presheaves supports (constructively!) both an interpretation of homotopy type theory and a compatible Quillen model structure. Here we consider the cube category with cartesian structure and one connection. I will present a proof that the model structure obtained for this cube category is Quillen equivalent to the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets. The obstacle to overcome is that this cube category is not a Reedy category: its morphisms do not factor into well-behaved "degeneracy" and "face" maps. We observe that it does, however, embed in a Reedy category in a nice way. We adapt the theory of so-called elegant Reedy categories to this relativized case, then use these results to prove the equivalence with simplicial sets.

                <p>Hofmann-Streicher universes (Hofmann and Streicher 1999) are a standard tool for modeling universes in presheaf models of dependent type theory. They have been used in the semantics of HoTT, e.g. in the cubical set model of Cohen et al. (2015).</p>
                <p>Hofmann and Streicher (op. cit.) noted that their approach to universes does not extend from presheaf models to arbitrary sheaf models. In this talk, we nevertheless extend the approach of Hofmann and Streicher to sheaf models *with enough points*. Consequently, we can handle many sheaf models without resorting to alternatives such as the stack semantics of Coquand et al. (2020). In particular, any model of sheaves on a topological space has enough points.</p>
                <p>Our approach will be to recover any sheaf model with enough points as a 'topos model of coalgebras' for an appropriate notion of comonad. This construction 'lifts' the universe in the topos model carrying the comonad to the sheaf model in question, yielding a Hofmann-Streicher universe. Our 'topos model of coalgebras' is a refinement of the well-known topos of coalgebras (Kock and Wraith 1971).</p>

                <p>Schemes are the corner stone of modern algebraic geometry and have been formalized in various proof assistants. However, the most prominent existing formalizations all follow the inherently non-constructive approach of Hartshorne's classic "Algebraic Geometry" textbook. Working in Cubical Agda, we want to give a constructive formalization of affine schemes in a univalent setting. We follow an approach due to Coquand, Lombardi and Schuster that uses a point-free description of the Zariski spectrum but otherwise proceeds by defining the structure sheaf on basic opens first and then lifting it to the whole spectrum. In this talk we will focus on the construction of the structure sheaf on basic opens as it is at this point that working in a univalent setting raises perhaps surprising issues while at the same time offering insightful solutions.</p>

                <p>In his PhD thesis, Brunerie defined the notorious 'Brunerie number' -- an integer n such that the fourth homotopy group of the 3-sphere is isomorphic to Z/n. He then managed to, with a lot of machinery, prove that |n| = 2. In an ideal world, this part of the proof is unnecessary: the fact that |n| = 2 should follow immediately by normalising n in a constructive proof assistant like Cubical Agda. In the real world, however, it's not that easy: Cubical Agda is too slow. So we have two obvious choices: we either give up, or we formalise all of Brunerie's original proof (me and my supervisor, Anders M√∂rtberg, have accepted both options at different points in time). Recently, however, I found a third option: even though normalisation doesn't work, there is still a very direct way of showing that |n| = 2. In fact, with my definition of n, we can show that n = -2. In this talk, I will give a sketch of this argument. If time permits, I will mention why this argument also shows that the fourth homotopy group of the 3-sphere is a subgroup of Z/2.</p>

                <p>Category theory is the study of structure across mathematics. Being a mathematical subject itself, category theory should also encompass the study of its own structural aspects.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Dependently typed algebraic theories are a generalisation of ordinary multisorted algebraic theories (finite-product theories). When it comes to models valued in Set, they are just as expressive as essentially algebraic theories (finite-limit theories). They also combine well with homotopy theory, and have a canonical notion of model up-to-homotopy in spaces, or "homotopy algebra", via a left Bousfield localisation of a global model structure on simplicial presheaves.</p>
                <p>In this talk, I will consider dependently typed algebraic theories to be a strict subclass of contextual categories. With respect to models valued in Set, this strict subclass is nevertheless just as expressive as essentially algebraic theories. Moreover, contextual categories in this subclass have a nice description of their homotopy algebras, generalising a definition of homotopy algebras of ordinary algebraic theories due to Badzioch and Bergner.</p>
                <p>Homotopy algebras of ordinary algebraic theories enjoy a rigidification theorem stating that every homotopy algebra is weakly equivalent to a strict simplicial algebra. I will report on recent joint work with S. Henry showing that the same is true for homotopy algebras of dependently typed algebraic theories. This result uses a weak factorisation system introduced by Henry on the category of Set-models of a contextual category, as well as Henry's notion of weak model category.</p>

                <p>Ordinals are a powerful tool when justifying induction and recursion, proving that processes terminate, or in mathematics generally. In classical set theory, there are many equivalent ways to introduce them, but in a constructive setting, the different notions split apart, with different advantages and disadvantages for each. I will consider three different notions of ordinals in homotopy theory theory: a "syntactic" notation system based on Cantor normal forms, a quotient inductive-inductive type of Brouwer trees, and wellfounded extensional orders from the HoTT book. Although defined very differently, all three notions have properties expected of ordinals: their order relations are extensional and wellfounded (and thus support transfinite induction), and the usual arithmetic operations can be defined in each case. Furthermore, the notions are connected in the sense that there are structure preserving non-surjective embeddings of Cantor normal forms into Brouwer trees, and of Brouwer trees into wellfounded extensional orders.</p>

                <p>I will present a further step in my ongoing research programme on Algebraic Type Theory, the overall aim of which is to develop a mathematical theory understanding type theories algebraically while supporting practical foundations. The talk will centre on Second-Order Algebraic Theories, which are equational presentations in languages with (first-order) algebraic type structure and (second-order) term structure with variable-binding operators and parametrised metavariables. Examples include: first-order logic, simply-typed computational calculi, and the calculus of partial differentiation.</p>
                <p>Specifically, I will present a new categorical model for Second-Order Algebraic Theories: it is based on indexed families and founded upon the initial-algebra approach. A main motivation for and crucial aspect of the mathematical theory is that it is directly programmable in languages supporting inductive families; and, indeed, was developed in unison with building a formally-verified computer implementation for second-order semantics, computation, and deduction. As such, the work resulted in a framework within the Agda proof assistant for the automatic generation of generic second-order abstract syntax and provably correct metaoperations for manipulating it; to wit, algebraic models together with compositional interpretations, capture-avoiding and metavariable substitution operations, and equational and/or rewriting reasoning.

                <p>Viewed as algebraic theories, clans are equally expressive as finite-limit theories but contain more information: the same finite-limit theory can have representations by different clans, and in particular different clans can have the same category of Set-models. The additional information encoded in a clan T gives rise to a weak factorization system (E,F) on the locally finitely presentable category Mod(T) (first considered by Henry), from which the clan can be reconstructed up to Morita equivalence.</p>
                <p>In earlier work I conjectured a characterization of ‚Äúclan-algebraic categories‚Äù -- i.e. lfp categories equipped with a wfs arising as models of a clan -- in terms of an exactness condition that generalizes an analogous characterization of categories of models of ordinary algebraic theories.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In the classical theory of simplicial sets and cubical sets there is an important class of maps known as Kan fibrations, which form part of a weak factorisation system on each category. There are several ways to define this class, amongst them "right lifting property against horn inclusions" and "right lifting property against pushout product of monomorphisms and endpoint inclusions." However in a constructive setting, the two definitions are not equivalent and while the latter definition is commonly used when working with cubical sets, only the former definition has been used in simplicial sets, in constructive mathematics. I'll give an explanation for this using a notion due to Shulman called "locally representable notion of fibred structure." Both definitions can be used to give a structured version of weak factorisation system, called algebraic weak factorisation system (awfs), where Kan fibrations are not just a class of maps, but a kind of algebraic structure that a map can possess. The awfs in cubical given by right lifting property against pushout product of monomorphisms and endpoint inclusion is locally representable, using the fact that in cubical sets the interval is tiny. I'll show however, that the corresponding awfs in simplicial sets is not locally representable.</p>

In his thesis, Brunerie has extracted specifically a set of rules that span all the combinatorics of weak omega-groupoids, and showed that these rules are satisfied by HoTT. Although a primitive way to reason within weak œâ-categories, like HoTT for the groupoids, is not known, we can still leverage Brunerie's approach to tackle the directed world.</p>
                <p>In this talk, I will present a joint work with Finster and Mimram, where we define a type theory √† la Brunerie for weak œâ-categories. I will show how to use this type theory in practice to carry proofs in the theory of weak omega-categories and present a proof assistant based off of these ideas. I will present a few syntactic considerations to improve the use of this proof assistant and discuss how they reveal a part of the structure of weak omega-categories.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In this talk we describe the key result in our paper "Predicative Aspects of Order Theory in Univalent Foundations". Our work is predicative and constructive, meaning that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms or excluded middle, respectively. Crudely formulated, our theorem says: Various kinds of posets can only be small in predicative HoTT/UF if they are trivial. In previous work, we observed that in HoTT/UF, the directed complete posets in the Scott model of PCF were large and the above result is telling us that this is unavoidable. We explain how to arrive at a precise formulation of our theorem, using a technical notion of a Œ¥ùì§-complete poset and a generalization of Johnstone's notion of positivity for locales. It is worth remarking that the precise formulation is in the spirit of reverse mathematics: it is a theorem of HoTT/UF (as opposed to a metatheorem about HoTT/UF) and in particular does not make reference to models.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In categorical semantics, we are used to think of individual categories with suitable structure as models of type theory. For example, every locally cartesian closed (lcc) category constitutes a separate model of extenstional type theory, a separate mathematical universe. Instead, this talk is about 1-categorical and higher categorical multiverse models, which are models made up of all (small) models. Thus the idea is to think of the category of all categories with suitable structure as a model of type theory. For example, from this perspective, the category of all lcc categories is a model of extensional type theory, which contains as submodels each of the traditional models given by individual lcc categories.</p>
                <p>As in ordinary categorical semantics, there are coherence problems to be solved to make this precise. Here the multiverse approach allows the use of model categorical (in the sense of Quillen) constructions such as algebraically (co)fibrant objects, which are otherwise inapplicable. These constructions can be combined into a new solution of the 1-categorical coherence problem. With some caveats, the technique is also applicable to the category of lcc ‚àû-categories. Here I will explain how a fragment of intensional dependent type theory can be interpreted in the category of lcc ‚àû-categories.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Hofmann has proven that the extension of intensional type theory (with Uniqueness of Identity Proofs) by the equality reflection rule is conservative. For HoTT or other type theories without UIP, we can consider extensions that replace some typal equalities by definitional equalities, such as the extension of HoTT by a strictly associative and unital addition on natural numbers.</p>
                <p>In this talk I will show that conservativity holds whenever the base type theory satisfies "external univalence" and the definitional equalities added by the extension are coherent, that is when "every formal composition of these equalities is trivial." The formal statements of these conditions involve some type-theoretic infinity-categories, i.e. infinity-categories that are presented by models of type theory.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>HoTT is expected to give internal languages for elementary ‚àû-toposes. As the first step towards this goal, Kapulkin and Lumsdaine made a precise formulation of the conjecture that dependent type theory with intensional identity types gives internal languages for finitely complete ‚àû-categories. This simple version of the internal language conjecture is still difficult due to the coherence problem. In ‚àû-categories, most equations hold up to homotopies, but type theories have a stricter notion of equality, judgmental equality.</p>
                <p>In this talk, we introduce an ‚àû-dimensional generalization of type theories which we call ‚àû-type theories to prove Kapulkin and Lumsdaine's conjecture. An ‚àû-type theory is like a type theory, but judgmental equality behaves like homotopies rather than strict equality, so there is no coherence problem between ‚àû-type theories and ‚àû-categories. The internal language conjecture is then reduced to a coherence problem between the type theory and a suitable ‚àû-type theory. We solve the new coherence problem by developing a splitting technique for models of the ‚àû-type theory.</p>
                <p>An advantage of our approach is that one can easily formulate internal language conjectures for richer type theories, for example type theories with function types, inductive types, and universes. Any internal language conjecture is then reduced to a coherence problem between a type theory and an ‚àû-type theory. Unfortunately, we have not yet found a general solution to the coherence problem (the splitting technique we present only works for intensional identity types). If time permits, we will discuss possible approaches to the general coherence problem.</p>

                <p>[In the following, read ``higher'' as ``(‚àû,1)-''.]</p>
                <p>It is a popular idiosyncrasy of higher toposes that, when defined in terms of Giraud-style axioms, a general representation result in terms of higher sheaf categories on a site appears to fail. Essentially, this discrepancy arises because ``sites'' here are implicitly understood to be higher categories equipped with proof-irrelevant (topo)logical data, while higher toposes are constructions within an intrinsically proof-relevant ambient world.</p>
                <p>In the first part of the talk, we use this intuition of ambient proof-relevance to further develop the characterization of higher toposes over a given higher base topos in terms of their associated left exact modalities (Appendix of [1], and [2]). We give a definition of higher sites respective a small higher base category C which expresses ``PreSh(C)-global localization'' in terms of ``C-indexed nullification'' with respect to an associated sheaf of ideals. In this context I will also mention how one can derive an associated notion of higher Lawvere-Tierney topology as well (which is work in progress).</p>
                <p>In the second part of the talk, we take a look at examples of such higher sites which are derived from classical examples considered in ordinary categorical logic. We will do so by simply ignoring the artificial propositional truncations implicit to these examples in the ordinary setting, and hence move away from the classical sheaf condition towards more general colimit-preserving properties. Such, so I hope, may be useful in the future for the study of the higher categorical semantics of intensional type theories.</p>

                <p>Proof assistants are getting more widespread use in research and industry to provide certified and independently checkable guarantees about theories, designs, systems and implementations. However, proof assistant implementations themselves are seldom formally verified, although they take a major share of the trusted code base in any such certification effort. In this area, proof assistants based on Higher-Order Logic enjoy stronger guarantees than the ones based on Dependent Type Theory, as self-certified implementations have been available for some years. One cause of this difference is the inherent complexity of dependent type theories together with their extensions with (co)-inductive types, universe polymorphism and complex sort or dimension systems. Another is the gap between theory on paper and practical implementations in efficient programming languages. In particular, an efficient implementation of definitional equality checking can be far away from its ideal specification.</p>
                <p>The MetaCoq project aims to tackle these difficulties in the case of the Coq proof assistant. It provides the first fully-certified realistic implementation of a type checker for the calculus underlying the Coq proof assistant. I will present how we refined the sometimes blurry, if not incorrect, specification and implementation of the system to produce:</p>
                <p>- A specification of Coq's syntax and type theory, the Polymorphic Cumulative Calculus of (Co)-Inductive Constructions (PCUIC)</p>
                <p>- A monad for the manipulation of raw syntax and interaction with the Coq system</p>
                <p>- A verification of PCUIC's metatheory, whose main results are the confluence of reduction, type preservation and principality of typing</p>
                <p>- A realistic, correct and complete type-checker for PCUIC</p>
                <p>Finally, I will focus on work in progress to relate the current specification of PCUIC to a presentation of type theory with typed equality.</p>

                <p>In programming language theory, the principle of representation independence states that programs indexed by structured types are invariant under a wide range of structure-preserving correspondences. The Structure Identity Principle (SIP) states that constructions in HoTT respect structured isomorphisms, but many instances of representation independence involve non-isomorphic types.</p>
                <p>In this talk, I will motivate representation independence, explain its connection to proof reuse and transfer, and recall the basics of cubical type theory and the SIP. Then, I will describe our recent work on a relational variant of the SIP that uses HIT quotients to improve representation independence scenarios into  structured isomorphisms and thence equalities of structured types. Our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.</p>

                <p>In this talk, I sketch my recent work on game semantics of homotopy type theory (HoTT). My aim is to extend the BHK-interpretation of Martin-L√∂f type theory to HoTT so that one can better understand HoTT as a foundation of constructive mathematics. In fact, this game semantics can be seen as a mathematical formalisation of the BHK-interpretation of HoTT: It interprets terms in HoTT as constructive "dialogical arguments" on the truths of formulas, i.e., constructive proofs, and in particular terms of Id-types as constructive proofs on the equality between constructive proofs. Further, the game semantics shows that the extension of HoTT by equational univalence, i.e., the judgemental equality between Id-type on a universe and type equivalence, is consistent, and Markov's principle is independent from this extended HoTT.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>In the first part of this talk, I will try to motivate why sheaf models are important for constructive mathematics on a specific example: the existence of the (separable) algebraic closure of a field.This is not trivial constructively since for an arbitrary field, it is in general not decidable if a given polynomial is irreducible or not.  One solution, going back to a short note of Andr√© Joyal "Les Th√©or√®mes de Chevalley-Tarski et remarques sur l'alg√®bre constructive", is to use a suitable (effective) sheaf model in which we can build the algebraic closure. I will explain this model and how it can be used to compute with algebraic numbers.</p>
                <p>One would like to express such a model using the language of type theory, but this is problematic since the roots of a given polynomial cannot be expressed as a function of the coefficients, and we cannot use strong sum to express existence of roots. This motivates the second part of the talk, where I will present joint work with Fabian Ruch and Christian Sattler on how to extend such sheaf models to sheaf models of (univalent) type theory. One can then express and prove results such that the fact that any Gm-torsor is trivial and start to ask if one can force the line (algebraic closure) to be contractible.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>When mapping out of a quotient into a 1-type, we find ourselves in the situation of needing to prove that a function is coherent in the following way: All cycles in the relation we quotient by are mapped to refl. Proving statements about all cycles is notoriously difficult because it does not straightforwardly admit induction.</p>
                <p>In practice, we often take quotients by binary relations which resemble reduction relations, and as such are co-wellfounded and locally confluent. In this talk I will show that under these circumstances, we can find an induction principle which can then be used to tackle this kind of coherence problem in HoTT. The main part of the proof is a purely graph theoretic construction, independent from its use in HoTT.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>‚ÄúInitiality‚Äù is the principle that the term model of some type theory should be an initial object in the category of models of that type theory.  Thomas Streicher gave a careful proof of initiality for the Calculus of Constructions in 1991.  Since then, initiality for more complex type theories (such as Martin-L√∂f type theory) has often been treated as established, as a straightforward extension of Streicher‚Äôs result, but never written up carefully for a larger theory.</p>
                <p>Around 2010, various researchers (notably Voevodsky) raised the question of whether these extensions really were sufficiently straightforward to consider them established without further proof.  Since then, views on the status of initiality have varied within the field; but the issue has been, at least, a frustrating unresolved point.</p>
                <p>In this talk, we present a proof of initiality for a full-featured Martin-L√∂f type theory.  The proof is formalised in Agda, to dispel any question of thoroughness (and also partly formalised in Coq), and is carefully designed for extensibility to other type theories.  The proof is based on Streicher‚Äôs, using some improvements of Hofmann and further refinements by the present authors.  The two formalisations present slightly different versions of the statement ‚Äî using contextual categories in Agda, categories with attributes in Coq ‚Äî but the core of the proof is parallel.</p>

                <p>Finster and Mimram recently introduced the simple type theory Catt [1], in which terms correspond to cells of a free weak infinity-category on a finite signature.

We give a decision procedure for determining when two terms are the same "up to units", which we add to the type theory as a definitional equality [2]. This yields a new, strong definition of strictly unital infinity-category, and gives a new type theory Catt_u in which homotopically complex path type inhabitants can be directly constructed, with a vast reduction in complexity compared to the base</p>

I will treat the case n=2 in details and prove that S2=S2 has exactly two connected components, equivalent to one another, with explicit elements (through univalence) for each of the components. The shape of these components though is much more mysterious, but I will outline why we should not expect S2=S2 to be equivalent to S2+S2.

                <p>Starting with the Awodey-Warren interpretation of identity types by path objects and Voevodsky's model of univalence in simplicial sets, various kinds of Quillen model categories have been used to interpret homotopy type theory.  A "type-theoretic model topos" is a Quillen model category that is optimal for this purpose in many respects.  On one hand, it has sufficient structure to interpret essentially all of "Book" HoTT, including in strict univalent universes and most higher inductive types.  On the other hand, it is sufficiently general that any Rezk-Lurie-Grothendieck (‚àû,1)-topos can be presented by a type-theoretic model topos.  This talk will sketch the definition of type-theoretic model topos and the proofs of these facts, including some variations of the definition that apply to models of cubical type theory.</p>

In this talk we describe an extension of HoTT intended to be modeled in the category of "parameterised spectra", where a modality is used to identify the types that correspond to individual spectra. A pair of axioms are considered that internalise some features of the intended model, and which fix the "homotopy groups" (appropriately defined) of the sphere spectrum to be the stable homotopy groups of the ordinary higher inductive spheres.</p>

                <p>The SIP only applies to objects that naturally form a 1-category. In this talk, I will discuss a Higher Structure Identity Principle in univalent foundations for structures that naturally form a higher category (e.g., categories themselves).</p>

                <p>Many variants of dependent type theory admit the semantics based on categories with families (CwFs). I introduce an abstract notion of a type theory to give a unified account of the CwF-semantics of type theory. The key idea is to regard a CwF-model of a type theory as a functor to a presheaf category preserving certain structures. Basic results in the semantics of type theory are then stated and proved in a purely categorical way. In this talk I will explain motivations and intuitions behind my definition of a type theory.</p>

                <p>In a 1926 article, Otto Schreier gave a classification of all extensions of a group G by a (non-abelian) group K. This classification of extensions has come to be known as Schreier theory, and has been reformulated many times by many authors since. Just as central extensions by an abelian group are classified by group cohomology in degree 2, Schreier theory can be seen as an example of a classification by non-abelian group cohomology.</p>
                <p>Higher Schreier theory concerns the classification of extensions of higher groups. Breen has generalized Schreier theory to sheaves of 2-groups. In this talk, we will give a proof of Schreier theory for oo-groups in homotopy type theory - and therefore for sheaves of ‚àû-groups by interpreting in various oo-toposes. Our main theorem is:</p>
                <p>Let G and K be ‚àû-groups. Then the type of extensions of G by K is equivalent to the type of actions of G on the delooping BK.</p>
                <p>One can immediately see the resemblence of this formulation of higher Schreier theory to the classification of split extensions of G by K by the homomorphic actions of G on K. We can derive this classification, and some others, as an immediate corollary.</p>
                <p>We will also discuss the notion of central extensions, and navigate some subtleties concerning the notion of centrality for higher groups.</p>

                <p>Indexed type theory is a version of homotopy type theory which represents indexed ‚àû-categories.

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Directed type theory is an analogue of homotopy type theory where types represent ‚àû-categories, generalizing groupoids. A bisimplicial approach to directed type theory, developed by Riehl and Shulman, is based on equipping each type with both a notion of path and a Septarate notion of directed morphism. In this setting, a directed analogue of the univalence axiom asserts that there is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations whose directed morphisms correspond to functions‚Äîa higher-categorical analogue of the category of sets and functions. In this talk, I‚Äôll present a constructive model of a directed type theory with directed univalence in bicubical, rather than bisimplicial, sets. We formalize much of this model using Agda as the internal language of a 1-topos, following Orton and Pitts. First, building on the cubical techniques used to give computational models of homotopy type theory, we show that there is a universe of covariant discrete fibrations, with a partial directed univalence principle asserting that functions are a retract of morphisms in this universe. To complete this retraction into an equivalence, we refine the universe of covariant fibrations using the constructive sheaf models by Coquand and Ruch. (Joint work with Dan Licata.)</p>

                <p>The model of higher categories given by Joyal's model structure for quasi-categories has univalent universes of coCartesian fibrations. This subsumes the existence of univalent universes of Kan fibrations proved by Voevodsky. Furthermore, the existence of such universes can be used as an alternative to the yoga of homotopy coherent nerves to prove all the essential features of higher category theory, giving a (directed) type theoretic approach to the foundations of higher categories.</p>

                <p>What type theorists and other researchers in type theory have in common is that they study theorems that hold of the initial model of type theory; but type theorists especially emphasize the theorems whose statements are sufficiently non-type-theoretic that they need not be preserved by homomorphisms of models. These theorems, sometimes called "metatheorems" or "admissibilities", are the means by which we conceive and justify computerized implementations of type theory, including canonicity, normalization, and decidability of type checking and judgmental equality.</p>
                <p>The main tool for proving such theorems is Tait's method of computability, which has in the past several years been subject to a rapid campaign of rectification using the categorical language of Artin gluing. I will give an overview of this brave new "objective computability", emphasizing my recent joint work with Angiuli and Gratzer on a general gluing theorem for models of MLTT along flat functors into Grothendieck topoi, with an application to cubical type theory.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>An important question in homotopy type theory is whether the existence of a model of univalent type theory in simplicial sets (and a model structure) can be proven constructively (say, in CZF with some inaccessibles). One approach would be to take the usual definition of a (trivial) Kan fibration as one's starting point and see how far one gets: this is the approach followed by Henry, Gambino, Szumilo and Sattler in recent work. It turns out that you can get quite far, but some issues remain (especially around the interpretation of Pi-types and coherence). Together with Eric Faber, I am pursuing a different approach in which we add uniformity conditions to the notion of a Kan fibration (as in the cubical sets model). The idea is that classically these conditions can always be satisfied, but not necessarily constructively. This has also been tried by Gambino and Sattler in earlier work, but in our view there are quite a few conditions missing in their definition of a uniform Kan fibration. In this talk, I will try to explain what our definition is, why we believe our definition is better (the idea is that we can prove, constructively, that it is "local"), and how far we are right now.</p>

                <p>In homotopical models of type theory such as cubical sets, propositional truncation has a rich structure. Instead of "identifying points," as in more traditional interpretations of extensional type theory in regular locally cartesian closed categories, one inductively adds new paths, while keeping existing points separate. This extra structure can be particularly clearly exposed by exploiting the fact that cubical sets are valid in a constructive metatheory, and assuming Brouwer's continuity principle, which is an anti-classical axiom stating that all functions from Baire space to the naturals are continuous. In this setting even very weak versions of the axiom of choice, such as WISC and a version of countable choice due to Escardo and Knapp, turn out to be false in the cubical set model. I will also talk about some very weak consequences of countable choice that are false in the model. This includes countable versions of collection and fullness from set theory (providing a solution to exercise 10.12 of the HoTT book). I will also talk about a couple of examples from homotopy theory: the product of countably many copies of the circle is not covered by any hSet and there are examples of hSets that are not covered by any constant cubical set.</p>

In the talk I will give an answer to this question in the form of a generalization that covers most of the cubical models. The crucial idea of this generalization is to weaken the notion of fibration from the cartesian cubical set model so that it is not necessary to assume that the diagonal on the interval is a cofibration. This notion of fibration also gives rise to a model structure, generalizing earlier work on constructing model structures from cubical models of homotopy type theory.</p>

                <p>There are many variants of dependent type theory, but it is difficult to find a complete and exact account of what a type theory is, as a formal system. We shall give a precise definition of what a type theory is in general, as a formal system whose components are various syntactic entities. The syntax of terms and types is described by a signature. Arbitrary inference rules are too unwieldy, so we next identify two properties that an acceptable rule must have. We similarly study what makes a family of rules into an acceptable type theory. To test the quality of our definition we prove fundamental meta-theorems about general type theories:</p>
                <p>1. Presupposition theorem: if a judgement is derivable then so are its presuppositions.</p>
                <p>2. Uniqueness of typing: if a term has type A and type B then A and B are judgmentally equal.</p>
                <p>3. Elimination of substitution: every derivable judgement can be</p>

                <p>In a previous HoTTEST talk, Eric Finster presented a coinductive definition of polynomial monads that should make it possible to formulate higher algebra internally in HoTT. In my talk, I will show how one can connect Finster's construction to the formalism of opetopes and opetopic objects, and its connection with the Baez-Dolan construction for polynomial monads. More precisely, I will give a reformulation of Finster's definition of polynomial monad in terms of opetopic types satisfying a kind of Segal condition. It will turn out that, once the basic notion of trees over a polynomial is established, Finster's coherence for magmas can be expressed purely in terms of polynomials and their maps. This should hopefully provide a first step towards comparing Finster's definition with the established ‚àû-categorical notion of polynomial monad.</p>

                <p>Modal type theory extends type theory with additional unary type constructors, representing functors, monads, and comonads of various sorts.  For example, the modalities discussed in the HoTT book are idempotent monads, while some recent extensions of HoTT make use of idempotent comonads.  Modal types can be used to speak synthetically about topology and geometry, and also have been used in the internal language semantics of cubical type theories. Over the past few years, we have been working on a general framework for modal type theories. In this framework, specific type theories can be specified by a signature---for example, "type theory with an idempotent monad and an idempotent comonad which are themselves adjoint".  Given a signature, instantiating general inference rules provides a syntax for working with the desired modal types.  While the framework does not automatically produce ``optimized'' inference rules for a particular modal discipline (where structural rules are as admissible as possible), it does provide a syntactic setting for investigating such issues, including a general equational theory governing the placement of structural rules in types and in terms.  While this is still work in progress, we hope to give a categorical semantics to the entire framework at once, saving the work of considering each modal type theory individually.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>A polymorphic function is intuitively said to be parametric when it behaves uniformly at all types. This concept was made precise by Reynolds, who defined parametric functions to be those with an action on relations and showed that all polymorphic functions definable in the simply-typed lambda-calculus are parametric. Recently, dependent type theories have been developed that internalize this property, which is known as parametricity; this work is closely connected to cubical type theory, both historically and methodologically. I'll discuss the similarities and differences between internally parametric and cubical type theory, the type theory we designed that combines the two, and potential applications to higher-dimensional theorem proving.</p>

                <p>Cubical type theory provides a constructive justification of homotopy type theory and satisfies canonicity: every natural number is convertible to a numeral.  A crucial ingredient of cubical type theory is a path lifting operation which is explained computationally by induction on the type involving several non-canonical choices.  In this talk I will present why if we remove these equations for the path lifting operation from the system, we still retain homotopy canonicity: every natural number is path equal to a numeral.  The proof involves proof relevant computability predicates (also known as sconing) and doesn't involve a reduction relation.</p>

                <p>First-order logic with isomorphism (‚ÄúFOLiso‚Äù) is a formal system which relates to HoTT and the Univalent Foundations in a similar way that first-order logic with equality relates to ZFC and set-theoretic foundations. In particular, FOLiso gives a precise framework in which to study ‚Äúfirst-order" theories defined on homotopy types (e.g. precategories, univalent categories), just as first-order logic with equality gives a precise framework in which to study first-order structures and theories defined on sets. I will first introduce the syntax and proof system of FOLiso as an extension of M. Makkai‚Äôs FOLDS. Then I will define a semantics for FOLiso in terms of homotopy types and describe a proof of soundness and completeness for this semantics.

Since its introduction, much effort has been expended to analyse, simplify and generalize what makes this model of the univalence axiom tick, using a variety of techniques. In this talk I will describe an axiomatic approach -- the isolation of a few elementary axioms about an interval and a universe of fillable shapes that allow a univalent universe to be constructed. Not all the axioms are visible in the original work; and the axioms can be satisfied in toposes other than the original presheaf topos of cubical sets.  The axioms and constructions can almost be expressed in Extensional Martin-L√∂f Type Theory, except that the global nature of some of them leads to the use of a modal extension of that language.

The emphasis of the talk will be on a framework  for quotienting by "directed" equivalence relations which I have  developed to attack problem (5), together with partial results and why  (5) is related to (1).</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Cubical type theory attracted much attention in the homotopy type theory community because it achieved canonicity in the presence of univalence and higher inductive types. To date, there are many variants of cubical type theory and experimental proof assistants based on them.</p>
                <p>It may seem that the remaining task is to reconnect the syntax to standard models, but there are still numerous type-theoretic open problems arising from the concerns over efficiency and usability. In this talk, I will give an overview of several topics we are working on but not publicly presented before, including extension types, empty systems, the interplay between kinds and higher inductive types, and more!</p>

                <p>I will try to survey what is known at this stage about constructive  models of univalence, and then some metatheoretical applications. Some of  these are: proof theoretic strength of the univalence axiom (with HITs), and   consistency of univalence with continuity principle and fan theorem, and  independence of the axiom of countable choice.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>We (Ambrus Kaposi and myself) have defined the intrisic (no preterms) syntax of type theory in type theory using quotient inductive inductive types, that is set truncated higher inductive inductive types. Set truncation is necessary because we want to have decidability which we established using normalisation by evaluation. However, this stops us from defining any interesting semantic models, e.g. interpreting contexts as sets, types as families etc, because sets do not from a set (not for size reason but dimension). I suggest that we can overcome this problem by defining higher models of type theory and a higher syntax. I envisage that the higher syntax does form a set without being explicitely truncated, hence decability should still hold. In my talk I will describe the first steps towards this programme.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Homotopy type theory is hypothesized to be an internal language for (‚àû,1)-toposes.  However, recent developments suggest that more than this, what is needed is an internal language for collections of several (‚àû,1)-toposes together with functors between them, such as adjunctions, monads, comonads, non-cartesian monoidal structures, and so on.  For instance, a cohesive (‚àû,1)-topos comes with an adjoint triple of two monads and a comonad, while a tangent (‚àû,1)-topos comes with a monad that is also a comonad and also a non-cartesian "smash product" monoidal structure.</p>
                <p>Just as ordinary homotopy type theory is a "doctrine" or "2-theory" for (‚àû,1)-toposes, each such situation should come with its own "2-theory": a dependent type theory with extra information characterizing the additional structure.  But developing even one dependent type theory formally is a lot of work, so we would like a general framework and a general theorem that can then simply be specialized to all such 2-theories.  I will sketch such a framework, which is under development in joint work with Dan Licata and Mitchell Riley.</p>

                <p>Homotopy type theory can be seen as a synthetic theory of infinity groupoids. From this perspective, the pointed, connected types represent infinity groups. The elements are those of the loop space, and the operations on identity types provide the higher group structure.</p>
                <p>In this talk, I'll explain what basic group theory looks like from this viewpoint. One aspect is that of categorifying ordinary group theory by using a univalent universe to present many groups. For example, the cyclic group on n elements is the loop space of the type of n-element sets equipped with a cyclic ordering.</p>
                <p>In the second half of the talk, I'll focus on the 2-dimensional orthogonal group, and use this to talk about the homotopy types of surfaces.</p>
                <p>The talk follows the synthetic approach to homotopy theory as developed in the HoTT book. Beyond that, a basic familiarity with ordinary group theory and the result on the classification of surfaces from topology will be helpful.</p>
                <p>Some of the material will be from arXiv:1802.04315 (joint with Floris van Doorn and Egbert Rijke) and arXiv:1802.02191 (joint with Favonia), and some material is brand new.</p>

              <div class="abstract">
                <p>Dependent types are simultaneously a theory of constructive mathematics and a theory of computer programming: a proof of a proposition is at the same time a program that executes according to a specification. Homotopy type theory reveals a third aspect of dependent types, namely their role as an extensible formalism for reasoning synthetically about objects with homotopical structure.  Unfortunately, axiomatic formulations of univalence and higher inductive types disrupt the computational character of type theory, which pivots on a property called canonicity.</p>
                <p>I will discuss Cartesian cubical type theory, a univalent type theory in which the canonicity property holds, based on a judgmental notion of cubes with diagonals, faces, and degeneracies, and uniform Kan operations that compute according to their types. I will consider it primarily through the lens of its computational semantics, defined using a cubical generalization of the technique of logical relations, which licenses reading proofs as programs.</p>
                <p>This talk is based on joint work with Favonia and Robert Harper, described in arXiv:1712.01800. Some familiarity with the syntax and rules of type theory will be very helpful; I will not assume knowledge about computational semantics or logical relations.</p>

                <p>Homotopy type theory provides a ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù framework that is suitable for developing the theory of mathematical objects with natively homotopical content. A famous example is given by (‚àû,1)-categories ‚Äî aka ‚Äú‚àû-categories‚Äù ‚Äî which are categories given by a collection of objects, a homotopy type of arrows between each pair, and a weak composition law. In this talk we‚Äôll compare two ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù developments of the theory of ‚àû-categories ‚Äî the first (joint with Verity) using 2-category theory and the second (joint with Shulman) using a simplicial augmentation of homotopy type theory due to Shulman ‚Äî by considering in parallel their treatment of the theory of adjunctions between ‚àû-categories. Afterwards, I hope to launch a discussion about what considerations might motivate the use of homotopy type theory in place of classical approaches to prove theorems in similar settings.</p>
                <p>Ideal background: some familiarity with notions of a (ordinary strict 1-)category, functor, natural transformation, and the definition of an adjunction involving a unit and a counit (just look these up on wikipedia). Plus standard type theory syntax and the intuitions from the Curry-Howard-Voevodsky correspondence. I‚Äôll be talking about (‚àû,1)-categories but won‚Äôt assume familiarity with them.</p>

                <p>Diagram models are a flexible tool for studying many logical systems: given a categorical model C and index category I, one hopes that the diagram category C I will again be a model.</p>
                <p>For the case of intensional type theory, this becomes a little tricky. Since most logical constructors (e.g. Œ£-types, Id-types) are not provably strictly functorial, it is difficult to lift them from structure on C to structure in C I, for arbitrary I.</p>
                <p>However, in case I is an inverse category ‚Äî roughly, something like the semi-simplicial category Œî I ‚Äî this difficulty can be surmounted by taking the types of C I to be Reedy types, analogous to Reedy fibrations in homotopy theory.</p>
                <p>I will discuss the construction of these models (and slightly more general homotopical diagram models) in the setting of categories with attributes, along with the application of these models to the ‚Äúhomotopy theory of type theories‚Äù.</p>
                <p>The work of this talk is joint work with Chris Kapulkin, in arXiv:1610.00037 and a forthcoming companion article; see also Shulman arXiv:1203.3253 for a closely related construction.</p>
                <p>A basic familiarity with categorical models of type theory will be helpful, i.e. categories with attributes or similar; see <a href="https://video-archive.fields.utoronto.ca/view/5057">https://video-archive.fields.utoronto.ca/view/5057</a> for an introductory overview of these.</p>
