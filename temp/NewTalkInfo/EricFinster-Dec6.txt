Abstract: I will propose a definition of "coherent cartesian polynomial monad" in type theory.  Special cases of the proposal yield definitions of ∞-operads, ∞-categories and ∞-groupoids.  In addition, I describe a definition of coherent algebra over such a monad, leading to a proposed internal description of objects such as En-types and diagrams of types valued in the universe.
I will report on progress towards formalizing the definition and suggest some constructions and applications making use of it.
