Abstract: One important question in the study of homotopy type theory is the characterization of its models. A crucial step towards solving this problem was taken by Shulman, who proved that we can interpret homotopy type theory in every Grothendieck (∞,1)-topos.
In this talk we want to show that his results can be generalized to certain (∞,1)-categories coming from filter products. We will use this result to construct new models of homotopy type theory that are not Grothendieck (∞,1)-toposes.
