Abstract: Finster and Mimram recently introduced the simple type theory Catt [1], in which terms correspond to cells of a free weak infinity-category on a finite signature. (Alternatively, these terms can be thought of as inhabitants of a directed path type.) We give a decision procedure for determining when two terms are the same "up to units", which we add to the type theory as a definitional equality [2]. This yields a new, strong definition of strictly unital infinity-category, and gives a new type theory Catt_u in which homotopically complex path type inhabitants can be directly constructed, with a vast reduction in complexity compared to the base
type theory. We give some illustrated examples, and speculate about future applications of these ideas to make path types in homotopy type theory easier to handle.
