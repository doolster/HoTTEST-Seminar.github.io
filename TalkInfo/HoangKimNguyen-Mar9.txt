Abstract: In this talk we will discuss directed univalence in simplicial sets and explain that the universal cocartesian fibration is indeed directed univalent. We further give a characterisation of directed univalent cocartesian fibrations, which explains that the domain of the universal left fibration embeds fully faithfully into the domain of the universal cocartesian fibration. 
This is joint work with Denis-Charles Cisinski.
