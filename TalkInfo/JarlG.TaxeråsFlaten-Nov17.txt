Abstract: We give a simple description of the type of H-space structures on a pointed type A. If A is an H-space, we obtain an untruncated version of a formula of Arkowitz--Curjel and Copeland for counting H-space structures on a space. This formula underlies the classical computations of the number of H-space structures on various spaces. As an example, we easily deduce that the type of H-space structures on the 3-sphere is equivalent to the six-fold loop space of the 3-sphere.
Our formula for the type of H-space structures on A leads us to define and study what we call "central" types, which are generalisations of Eilenberg--Mac Lane types. Central types admit a unique H-space structure which can be explicitly delooped by a tensor product of "types banded by A." Given an abelian group A, we iterate this process to give an independent construction of K(A,n) along with a description of its H-space structure that is useful for certain cohomology computations.
These results are part of joint, ongoing work with Ulrik Buchholtz, Dan Christensen, David Jaz Myers, and Egbert Rijke. Most of the results have been formalized using the Coq-HoTT library.
