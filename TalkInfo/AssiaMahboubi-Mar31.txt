Abstract: (joint work with Pierre-Marie Pédrot and Martin Baillon)
A result due to M. Escardó establishes the continuity of all functionals definable in Gödel's system T. In this talk, we discuss how to generalize the result to a richer, dependent type theory. Via the construction of a syntactic model, akin to the effectful forcing of Escardó's proof, we obtain an external proof of continuity for any functional |- f : (nat -&gt; nat) -&gt; nat definable in this type theory.
