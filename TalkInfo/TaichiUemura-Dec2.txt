Abstract: HoTT is expected to give internal languages for elementary ∞-toposes. As the first step towards this goal, Kapulkin and Lumsdaine made a precise formulation of the conjecture that dependent type theory with intensional identity types gives internal languages for finitely complete ∞-categories. This simple version of the internal language conjecture is still difficult due to the coherence problem. In ∞-categories, most equations hold up to homotopies, but type theories have a stricter notion of equality, judgmental equality.
In this talk, we introduce an ∞-dimensional generalization of type theories which we call ∞-type theories to prove Kapulkin and Lumsdaine's conjecture. An ∞-type theory is like a type theory, but judgmental equality behaves like homotopies rather than strict equality, so there is no coherence problem between ∞-type theories and ∞-categories. The internal language conjecture is then reduced to a coherence problem between the type theory and a suitable ∞-type theory. We solve the new coherence problem by developing a splitting technique for models of the ∞-type theory.
An advantage of our approach is that one can easily formulate internal language conjectures for richer type theories, for example type theories with function types, inductive types, and universes. Any internal language conjecture is then reduced to a coherence problem between a type theory and an ∞-type theory. Unfortunately, we have not yet found a general solution to the coherence problem (the splitting technique we present only works for intensional identity types). If time permits, we will discuss possible approaches to the general coherence problem.
