Abstract: In programming language theory, the principle of representation independence states that programs indexed by structured types are invariant under a wide range of structure-preserving correspondences. The Structure Identity Principle (SIP) states that constructions in HoTT respect structured isomorphisms, but many instances of representation independence involve non-isomorphic types.
In this talk, I will motivate representation independence, explain its connection to proof reuse and transfer, and recall the basics of cubical type theory and the SIP. Then, I will describe our recent work on a relational variant of the SIP that uses HIT quotients to improve representation independence scenarios into  structured isomorphisms and thence equalities of structured types. Our results are formalized in Cubical Agda.
