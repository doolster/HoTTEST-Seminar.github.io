Abstract: While the original definition of an elementary topos assumed the existence of finite colimits, modern definitions avoid this assumption as, due to work of Mikkelsen and Pare, finite colimits can be recovered from the remaining axioms. 
In recent years we have witnessed the rise of homotopical foundations in the form of homotopy type theory and elementary ∞-topos theory, which, analogous to elementary toposes, assume the existence of finite colimits. Given the historical trajectory we can ask ourselves whether we can again recover them from the other axioms.
In this work we take a first step towards addressing this problem by constructing an initial object and coproducts in a locally Cartesian closed ∞-category with subobject classifier, using ideas from type theory.
This is joint work with Jonas Frey.
