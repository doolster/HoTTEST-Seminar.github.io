Abstract: Hofmann-Streicher universes (Hofmann and Streicher 1999) are a standard tool for modeling universes in presheaf models of dependent type theory. They have been used in the semantics of HoTT, e.g. in the cubical set model of Cohen et al. (2015).
Hofmann and Streicher (op. cit.) noted that their approach to universes does not extend from presheaf models to arbitrary sheaf models. In this talk, we nevertheless extend the approach of Hofmann and Streicher to sheaf models *with enough points*. Consequently, we can handle many sheaf models without resorting to alternatives such as the stack semantics of Coquand et al. (2020). In particular, any model of sheaves on a topological space has enough points.
Our approach will be to recover any sheaf model with enough points as a 'topos model of coalgebras' for an appropriate notion of comonad. This construction 'lifts' the universe in the topos model carrying the comonad to the sheaf model in question, yielding a Hofmann-Streicher universe. Our 'topos model of coalgebras' is a refinement of the well-known topos of coalgebras (Kock and Wraith 1971).
