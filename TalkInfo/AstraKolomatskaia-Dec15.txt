Abstract: This talk consists of two parts:
First, we explore just how far one can get to the goal of constructing semi-simplicial types in MLTT. When being first introduced to the problem, it strikes one that there is an evident pattern in simplex types. We codify this pattern using the notion of a simple inverse category and construct untyped syntactic expressions. A challenge is posed to the audience to construct typing derivations, hence "externally" constructing SSTs. Unfortunately, it seems that internalising typing derivations is not possible (HoTT can't eat itself).
Second, we propose a work in progress modification to MLTT that we expect to enable the construction of SSTs. We generalise from asking for a type of SSTs to asking for a type structure of SSTs, which includes every order of dependent/displayed SSTs. In this more general setting, the object "SST" acquires a universal property that can be expressed via the notion of non-Type-valued coinduction. We explain how this endows "SST" with a mapping-in universal property that enables extracting simplex types. To demonstrate the utility of this universal property, we construct the singular semi-simplicial types.
The second half of this talk consists of joint work with Michael Shulman.
