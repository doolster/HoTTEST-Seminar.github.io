Abstract: In this talk, I sketch my recent work on game semantics of homotopy type theory (HoTT). My aim is to extend the BHK-interpretation of Martin-LÃ¶f type theory to HoTT so that one can better understand HoTT as a foundation of constructive mathematics. In fact, this game semantics can be seen as a mathematical formalisation of the BHK-interpretation of HoTT: It interprets terms in HoTT as constructive "dialogical arguments" on the truths of formulas, i.e., constructive proofs, and in particular terms of Id-types as constructive proofs on the equality between constructive proofs. Further, the game semantics shows that the extension of HoTT by equational univalence, i.e., the judgemental equality between Id-type on a universe and type equivalence, is consistent, and Markov's principle is independent from this extended HoTT.
