Abstract: Category theory is the study of structure across mathematics. Being a mathematical subject itself, category theory should also encompass the study of its own structural aspects.
A promising approach (Gray 1974; Di Liberti & Loregian 2019) is formal category theory: studying the properties of the bicategory of categories which make it possible to study category theory from a structural perspective.
A different idea is to approach categories as groupoids with extra structure, something which finds itself naturally at home in HoTT, where "groupoids" are particular types. This approach lends itself particularly well to formalization in a proof assistant.
In the context of Cubical Agda, we recap the basic theory of univalent categories (Ahrens, Kapulkin & Shulman 2013) and the move towards higher univalent category theory (Capriotti & Kraus 2017; Ahrens et all 2019), particularly the application of cubical syntax to fibred categories (following Sterling & Angiuli 2021; Ahrens & Lumsdaine 2017).
