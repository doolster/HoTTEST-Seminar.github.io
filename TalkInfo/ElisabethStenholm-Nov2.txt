Abstract: In 1978 Aczel gave a model of constructive set theory (CZF), which includes theaxiom of foundation, in Martin-Löf type theory (MLTT) [1]. Then, in 1989, Lindström gave a different model, also in MLTT, of constructive set theory, butwith foundation replaced by Aczel's anti-foundation axiom (AFA) [2]. Both of these models were setoid based. Starting from Aczel's 1978 model of well-founded sets, Gylterud defined a subtype of the type Aczel used. This subtype is in fact the initial algebra of the (restricted) powerset functor, and thus also forms a model of constructive set theory, but one where equality is interpreted as the identity type [3]. 
In this work, we dualise the construction of Gylterud, to obtain a model of non-wellfounded sets, where equality is interpreted as the identity type, as opposed to Lindström's model. The expectation was that the dualised construction would be the terminal coalgebra of the powerset functor, in which case it would be a model of CZF⁻ together with AFA. It turns out, however, that it is not the terminal coalgebra of the powerset functor. But all is not lost, for it is a fixed point of the functor, and in addition, it is terminal with respect to embeddings. This gives us instead a model of CZF⁻ together with Scott's anti-foundation axiom.
