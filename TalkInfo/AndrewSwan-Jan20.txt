Abstract: In the classical theory of simplicial sets and cubical sets there is an important class of maps known as Kan fibrations, which form part of a weak factorisation system on each category. There are several ways to define this class, amongst them "right lifting property against horn inclusions" and "right lifting property against pushout product of monomorphisms and endpoint inclusions." However in a constructive setting, the two definitions are not equivalent and while the latter definition is commonly used when working with cubical sets, only the former definition has been used in simplicial sets, in constructive mathematics. I'll give an explanation for this using a notion due to Shulman called "locally representable notion of fibred structure." Both definitions can be used to give a structured version of weak factorisation system, called algebraic weak factorisation system (awfs), where Kan fibrations are not just a class of maps, but a kind of algebraic structure that a map can possess. The awfs in cubical given by right lifting property against pushout product of monomorphisms and endpoint inclusion is locally representable, using the fact that in cubical sets the interval is tiny. I'll show however, that the corresponding awfs in simplicial sets is not locally representable.
