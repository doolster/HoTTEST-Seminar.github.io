Abstract: The smash product is a very useful operation in algebraic topology and  it can be defined in HoTT as a certain higher inductive type. One of  its basic properties is the fact that it is a (1-coherent) monoidal  product on pointed types, but proving this fact turns out to be very  technical.
I will present some work in progress aiming at proving it via some  form of higher dimensional rewriting and meta-programming. The idea is  to write an (untrusted) external program to generate a formal proof,  which can then be formally checked by a proof assistant.
