Abstract: Using Riehlâ€“Shulman's simplicial type theory for synthetic higher category theory, I'll describe how to define and work with (co)cartesian families. These represent functors from a higher category to the category of categories. As an application, I'll derive a (dependent) Yoneda lemma for such families. This is joint work with Jonathan Weinberger.
