Abstract: We propose an axiomatization of synthetic categories that allows to develop most of (infinity-)category theory from first principles, without relying on explicit set-theoretic models.
We expect that such a synthetic theory can make it easier to practice (infinity-)category theory for non-experts and teach it to beginners; moreover, it lends itself to formalization in proof assistants.
This talk is based on an ongoing long-term project with D.-C. Cisinski, B. Cnossen and K. Nguyen.
