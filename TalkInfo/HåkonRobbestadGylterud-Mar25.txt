Abstract: Since the advent of homotopy type theory, many different formal theories for HoTT (such variations of Martin-Löf’s theory, cubical type theory, ⋯) have joined the already plentiful ranks of formal theories. In this talk, we will try to outline a general, algebraic and combinatorial notion of formal theory – geared towards dependent type theories – based on work by Cartmell, Makkai and others.
The notion of theory we present is being implemented in a software framework aimed at working with different theories and translations between them, called Myott. Thus, part of the presentation will focus on the Haskell implementation of the theoretical notions.
