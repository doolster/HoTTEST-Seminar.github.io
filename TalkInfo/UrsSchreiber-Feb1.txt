Abstract: It is interesting to observe that a use-case of what deserves to be called genuine “homotopical computation” is secretly known: We showed in arXiv:2303.02382 (in print at Comm. Math. Phys., see <a href="ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/TQC+in+HoTT">ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/TQC+in+HoTT</a>) that the specification of the logic gates envisioned in “topological quantum computation on anyons”, while intricate in traditional language, have a slick expression in HoTT, simply as transport of certain truncated dependent function types into Eilenberg-MacLane types. The mathematical theorems behind this are a remarkable result on conformal quantum field theory by Feigin, Schechtmann & Varchenko (1994) combined with our novel algebro-topological construction, lending itself to formalization in HoTT, of Gauss-Manin connections on fibrations of twisted cohomology groups.
Generally, the relation between HoTT and quantum computation is closer than might be suspected: Adding rules meant to enforce interpretation of HoTT into infinity-topoi of parameterized module spectra (such as Riley’s *Linear HoTT*) naturally provides for an expressive certification-language for quantum programming with “dynamic lifting” of quantum measurement results (arXiv:2310.15735, <a href="ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Quantum+Monadology">ncatlab.org/schreiber/show/Quantum+Monadology</a>), previously elusive but arguably necessary for any serious quantum computation.
